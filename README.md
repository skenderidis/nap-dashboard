# NGINX APP Protect (NAP) Dashboard

This project simplifies your SecOps team's workflow with the NGINX APP Protect (NAP) Dashboard, leveraging Grafana Dashboards for streamlined review and analysis of violations.

<p align="center">
<img width="720" src="images/main.gif"/>
</p>

The solution employs an ingestion solution (**FluentD** or **Logstash**) for seamless log ingestion from NAP instances, transforming the data, and storing it in Elasticsearch indexes. Grafana acts as the analytics platform, connecting to Elasticsearch as the datasource and offering interactive dashboards.

In the following sections we will cover the following:

- [Transforming NAP logs](#transforming-nap-logs)
- [Dashboards](#nap-dashboards)
- [Installation](#installation)

## Transforming NAP logs

Starting with NAP release 4.3, the **json_log** field includes the Violation details formatted in JSON. While json_log doesn't provide yet the details for all violation types, it makes it significant easier and faster to parse NAP logs compared to the key/value pairs and the XML violation details.
Moreover, with each release, more violations are incorporated into the **json_log** field, making it the preferred method for logging violation details.

To check which violations are currently supported with **json_log** field please click [here](supported_violations.md)

Below, we outline the contents of the json_log field. Take a closer look on the following variables; `url`, `rawRequest.httpRequest` and the `violations`.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/json_log.png"/>
</p>

The `url` and `rawRequest.httpRequest` are Base64 encoded, while `violations` presents an array with each violation recorded on the transaction.

With the use of Logstash or FluentD we perform the following transformations:

- Base64 decoding for `url` and `rawRequest.httpRequest`
- Enriching the log with the GeoIP point of the SourceIP
- Create separate logs for each item in the `violations` array.
- Base64 decode the entries within the `violations` array.

> **Note**: Until Bot logs are incorporated into **json_log**, we have manually included them as additional JSON key/value pairs that we are extracting manually.

We offer two options for log ingestion/transformation: **FluentD** or **Logstash**, each supported by configuration examples to suit your preference and environment. For Logstash, we provide configuration examples tailored for Docker environments, whereas for FluentD, we offer configuration examples optimized for Kubernetes setups. Choose the option that best aligns with your infrastructure and requirements.

## Installation

To run this Dashboard you will need to deploy the following open source solutions:

- Logstash (or FluentD)
- Elasticsearch
- Grafana
- Docker
- Docker Compose

Steps will be provided on how to deploy all of the software in a Docker environment using Docker Compose. It is assumed that Docker and Docker Compose are already installed and configured on the system.
While we will provide the installation details for Logstash by default, at the end of the section we will provide details on how to use FluentD instead of Logstash.

### Clone the repo

Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/skenderidis/nap-dashboard` and switch the working directory to be `nap-policy-management/dashboard`

```shell
git clone https://github.com/skenderidis/nap-dashboard
cd nap-dashboard
```

### Install Logstash-Elasticsearch-Kibana-Grafana using docker-compose

```shell

```

***NOTES:***

>  - Logstash is configured on port 8515. Please use this port to send the logs from NGINX App Protect.
>  - Change the timezone used in the docker containers by altering the inline environment variable in the command above accordingly to your location. A list of TZ Database Names can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

### Configure Elasticsearch

> In you are not running the following commands from your docker host, please change `localhost` to the hostname or IP address of your docker host.

1. Create index template for the NAP Logs

    ```shell
    curl -d "@elastic/index-template-waf.json" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X PUT 'http://localhost:9200/_index_template/nginx-nap-logs'
    ```

    Expected Response: `{"acknowledged":true}`

### Configure Grafana

1. Setup Grafana sources

    ```shell
    curl -d "@grafana/DS-waf-index.json" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u 'admin:admin' -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/datasources/'
    curl -d "@grafana/DS-waf-decoded-index.json" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u 'admin:admin' -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/datasources/'

### Configure Logging profile for NAP

For NAP working on an Ingress please configure the following logging format

```yaml
apiVersion: appprotect.f5.com/v1beta1
kind: APLogConf
metadata:
  name: logconf
spec:
  content:
    format: user-defined
    format_string: "{\"campaign_names\":\"%threat_campaign_names%\",\"bot_signature_name\":\"%bot_signature_name%\",\"bot_category\":\"%bot_category%\",\"bot_anomalies\":\"%bot_anomalies%\",\"enforced_bot_anomalies\":\"%enforced_bot_anomalies%\",\"client_class\":\"%client_class%\",\"client_application\":\"%client_application%\",\"json_log\":%json_log%}"
    max_message_size: 30k
    max_request_size: "500"
    escaping_characters:
    - from: "%22%22"
      to: "%22"
  filter:
    request_type: illegal
```

For NAP working on a Docker or on a VM implementation, please configure the following logging format

```json
{
    "filter": {
        "request_type": "illegal"
    },
  
    "content": {
        "format": "user-defined",
        "format_string": "{\"campaign_names\":\"%threat_campaign_names%\",\"bot_signature_name\":\"%bot_signature_name%\",\"bot_category\":\"%bot_category%\",\"bot_anomalies\":\"%bot_anomalies%\",\"enforced_bot_anomalies\":\"%enforced_bot_anomalies%\",\"client_class\":\"%client_class%\",\"client_application\":\"%client_application%\",\"json_log\":%json_log%}", 
        "max_request_size": "500",
        "max_message_size": "30k",
        "escaping_characters": [
         {
            "from": "%22%22",
            "to": "%22"
         }  
      ]      
    }
  }
  ```

### Using FluentD instead of Logstash

1. Remove the logstash from the docker-compose file to save some resources.

1. Go to the fluentd folder of the repo and deploy the services below

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f ns-sa.yaml
    kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f service.yaml
    ```

1. Point your nap instance to the fluentd service that runs inside your kubernetes environment. It should be similar to **fluentd-svc.fluentd:8515**

1. **(optional)** Create your own FluentD image

  Currently the existing image `skenderidis/nap-fluentd` has been created based on the instructions from the official FluentD repo (
  https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset/blob/master/docker-image/v1.16/debian-elasticsearch8/Dockerfile) and we have added 3 additional plugins:

  - **`fluent-plugin-geoip`** that will enrich the GeoIP based on the client's source IP
  - **`fluent-plugin-nginx-nap-split`** that will split the violations array into multiple entries
  - **`fluent-plugin-nginx-nap-decode`** that will base64 decode the values within each violation

  If you want to build your own image from scratch, then follow the instructions from the FluentD repo
  (https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset/blob/master/docker-image/v1.16/debian-elasticsearch8/Dockerfile)
  on how to create a FluentD image.

  For your reference below you can find the Dockerfile and Gemfile that have been used for creating the current image.

  - [DockerFile](https://github.com/skenderidis/docker-images/blob/main/fuentd/Dockerfile)
  - [Gemfile](https://github.com/skenderidis/docker-images/blob/main/fuentd/Gemfile)
